# Container Images

Images are hosted on Quay [here](https://quay.io/repository/truecharts).
 


## Mirror

We host a dedicated mirror repository, these containers are directly fetched from official and/or trusted sources.

### Purpose

We host our own mirror for a multitude of reasons, which include:

- Getting around Docker Hub rate-limiting
- Preventing upstream maintainers from removing tags resulting breaking our apps
- Generating usage metrics
- Applying patches
- Improving code uniformity
- Allowing multi-registry failover
